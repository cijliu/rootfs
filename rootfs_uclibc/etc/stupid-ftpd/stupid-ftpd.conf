# This is a config-file for stupid-ftpd
# ------------------------------------
#
# The standard path should be /etc/stupid-ftpd.conf
# You can define other paths by using the "-f" option
# when starting stupid-ftpd.
#
#
# ATTENTION: 1) Remember, that the server is running with YOUR permissions.
#            It will fail to access other users directory, unless it is
#            root, but it also allows to access ALL YOUR directories,
#            which are deeper in a user's root-dir and YOU HAVE access to.
#            2) To solve the problem, the best way is to define a group-ID
#	        for stupid-ftpd. 
#		Or if you aren't root: set the MAIN root (serverroot=) to
#		the highest directory depth which is possible.
#            3) REMEMBER: DO NOT PUT THIS FILE in an accessible directory!!!
#               There are passwords defined here. The safest place is
#               outside the serverroot.
